▪ The capital of a country has a direct connection with the capitals of the 
  countries with which it borders. The ports of a country, besides connecting with all the ports of the same country, the port closest to the 
  capital of the country connects with it; and finally, each port of a country 
  connects with the n closest ports of any other country.

representation and ensuring the indistinct manipulation of capitals and 
seaports
