# US108 - The usage of a relational database

**What is a relational database?**
* A relational database is a database that organizes tables by linking them using common data between them. By using this type of database, we can use one single query to obtain data from one or more tables.

**Advantages of using a relational database**
* A relational database has various advantages when compared to the non-relational counterpart. The main reason to use a relational database is, as said previously, the capacity of retrieving data from several tables with one single query by joining the tables.
* Other advantages include: mature and well-documented technologies; is supported by established corporations; SQL standards are well-defined and commonly accepted; a large pool of qualified developers have experience with SQL and RDBMS; all RDBMS are ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability); flexibility, with the use of DDL (data definition language) that allows the creation of new tables and addition of new columns to the existing tables, renaming relations and other changes in the database itself; reduced redundancy with the normalization of the tables; always has a backup that restores data in a case of failure.
