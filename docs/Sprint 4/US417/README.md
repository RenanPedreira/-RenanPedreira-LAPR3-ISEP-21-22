LAPR3 2021-2022 Integrative Project - Sprint 4
=============================================================================

## JIRA Issue: LAP22G99-211 ##


## [US417] As the Ship Captain I want the technical team to search for at least three types of 
ship/vessels that are better suited to the task (e.g., depending on the type of cargo), in 
which the “control” bridge can assume three positions, one in the bow, one in the stern, 
and finally in the midship.
